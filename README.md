|  As part of my university labs, I developed a personal project using Python, focusing on two entities: Persons and Events. The project involved creating functions to manage these entities and their relationships. |

| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design** | Designed and implemented two entities using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase. Each entity was encapsulated with clearly defined attributes and methods, focusing on reducing redundancy and improving readability. The design ensured flexibility for future feature extensions. |
| **CRUD Operations with MySQL**  | Developed a fully functional **CRUD system** integrated with a **MySQL database**. Implemented database operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records with robust error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure data consistency. The implementation was optimized for performance and scalability, supporting dynamic data changes. |
| **User-Friendly GUI**           | Built an interactive and intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **Python Tkinter**. The interface featured multiple tabs, each designed for specific operations, enabling users to easily navigate and perform tasks. Custom widgets and layouts were implemented to enhance usability and provide a seamless experience. |
| **Layered Architecture**        | Designed and implemented the project using a **layered architecture** to separate concerns and enhance maintainability. The application was structured into four distinct layers: **UI (User Interface)** for managing interactions, **Service Layer** for handling business logic, **Domain Layer** for defining core entities, and **Test Layer** for quality assurance, ensuring a clear and scalable structure. |
| **Testing with unittest and TDD** | Designed and executed a comprehensive testing suite using **`unittest`**, adhering to **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices. Tests were written before developing functionalities to ensure each feature met the requirements. Covered a wide range of edge cases and scenarios, ensuring high reliability and minimizing the risk of bugs. |
| **Development Workflow**        | Adopted a structured development workflow starting with **designing wireframes and prototypes in Figma**, followed by iterative coding and testing. Used **Git with feature branches** to manage version control, enabling safe experimentation and efficient team collaboration. Regular commits and pull requests ensured the codebase remained stable and up-to-date. |
